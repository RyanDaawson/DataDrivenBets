# Sports Betting Picks Project

This project is designed to provide data-driven insights for sports betting picks. It collects, analyzes sports data, generates predictions, and presents these through a web interface.

## Project Structure

### /src

#### Data Collection

- **SportsDataCollector.cs**: Responsible for collecting sports data from external sources. This includes interfacing with sports data APIs or performing web scraping to gather historical and real-time data on teams, games, and player statistics. It must handle data normalization and storage for further analysis.

#### Data Analysis

- **DataAnalyzer.cs**: Analyzes the collected sports data to find patterns, trends, and potentially predictive insights. This file should contain algorithms for statistical analysis or machine learning models designed to assess the outcome of sports events. The goal is to process historical data to generate reliable betting picks.

#### Backend API

- **PredictionsController.cs**: Serves as the API controller for the application. This file exposes endpoints to retrieve betting predictions, offering an interface for the frontend to access the data produced by `DataAnalyzer.cs`. It handles client requests, calls the analysis logic, and returns the formatted predictions.

- **Startup.cs**: Sets up configurations for the ASP.NET Core application, including middleware, services, and API routes. This file is crucial for initializing the backend environment, ensuring that all components are correctly wired and ready to serve content.

#### Frontend Web Interface

- **index.html**: The entry point for the web UI. This HTML file structures the web page, providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the betting predictions. It should be designed with clear navigation and presentation of data.

- **styles.css**: Contains the styling for the web UI. This CSS file ensures that the website is visually appealing and that the data is presented in an easy-to-read format.

- **app.ts**: The main TypeScript file for the frontend logic. It handles user interactions, calls the backend API to fetch predictions, and updates the UI with the received data. This script should manage event listeners, data fetching, and DOM manipulation to reflect the latest predictions.

### /tests

Contains unit and integration tests for each component of the project, ensuring reliability and correctness.

#### Data Collection Tests

- **SportsDataCollectorTests.cs**: Tests the data collection logic, verifying that external data sources are accessed correctly and that the data is accurately fetched and normalized.

#### Data Analysis Tests

- **DataAnalyzerTests.cs**: Ensures that the analysis and prediction algorithms correctly process the data, generating valid outputs. These tests should cover various scenarios and data sets to validate the model's effectiveness.

#### API Tests

- **PredictionsControllerTests.cs**: Tests the API endpoints, ensuring that they correctly handle requests and return the expected predictions. This includes testing response formats, error handling, and integration with the data analysis components.

### Documentation and Configuration

- **README.md**: Provides an overview of the project, including setup, structure, and contribution guidelines. This document is essential for onboarding new developers or revisiting the project after a break.

- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Outlines guidelines and best practices for contributing to the project, ensuring consistent code quality and collaboration.

- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories that should be ignored by Git, such as build outputs, temporary files, and sensitive configuration.

- **LICENSE**: Defines the legal licensing terms for the project, protecting both contributors and users.

### CI/CD and Scripts

- **build.yml**: A GitHub Actions workflow script for continuous integration and deployment, automating testing, building, and deployment processes.

- **deploy_script.ps1**: A PowerShell script for deploying the application to a server or cloud environment. It should handle tasks such as setting environment variables, installing dependencies, and starting the application.
